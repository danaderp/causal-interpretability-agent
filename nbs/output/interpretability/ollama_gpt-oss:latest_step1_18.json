Provide at most three counterfactual answers. Estimate a probability of occurrence for each answer based solely on the causal graph in Graphviz DOT format. The outcome must be contained in a json format in which the first level comprises the name of the counterfactual answer; the second level comprises a description of the answer, a step by step of the rationale of that counterfactual answer, and the probability of occurrence."
