Since the method still acquires a write lock on the containing object but does not lock the shared `Transaction`, two threads could enter `t.perform()` simultaneously, each reading and writing to the same internal state. This would lead to lost updates or invalid data.

This could produce non‑deterministic results or flaky behavior in tests and production.
